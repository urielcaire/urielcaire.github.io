### Author: Uriel CairÃª Balan Calvi
jBility is a free set of accessibility functions that uses JQuery.  
The goal is to allow people with low vision to see your website's content.

# What does jBility?
Currently jBility has three functions:

1 **Contrast**: Changes the css of your page, highlighting texts and links. This function uses cookies to work. By default, the cookie die when browser is closed.

2 **Increase Font**: Increases all fonts of your page.

3 **Decrease Font**: Decreases all fonts of your page.

These functions make it easier to view a page's content.

# Example
To see a simple page with jBility working, download or clone jBility project and move it to your localhost and then just access it.
Or see now in [JQueryScript](http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Plugin-For-Better-Page-Accessibility-Readability-jbility/ "jBility demo").

# Installation
1 Download or clone jBility project and copy the **jbility.js** file to YOUR project folder. Reference it in your HTML.

2 Download the [latest JQuery] version to your project and reference it in your html.

3 Copy/move **img** folder to your project's root.

4 Insert the code below on your footer or before close body:
